   - Visualize volatility patterns using time-series plots and heatmaps.

3. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Create rolling averages, volatility ratios, and liquidity metrics.  
   - Add derived technical indicators (e.g., Bollinger Bands, ATR).

4. **Model Building:**  
   - Implement Random Forest Regressor for volatility prediction.  
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation.  

5. **Model Evaluation:**  
   - Evaluate model using MAE, RMSE, and R¬≤.  
   - Interpret feature importance and prediction accuracy.  

6. **Model Saving & Deployment:**  
   - Save trained model and scaler (`.joblib` files).  
   - Ready for integration into financial analytics dashboards.
