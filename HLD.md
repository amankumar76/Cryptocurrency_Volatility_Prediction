# High-Level Design (HLD)  
**Project:** Cryptocurrency Volatility Prediction  
**Author:** Aman Kumar  

---

## 1️⃣ Project Objective

The objective of this project is to **predict cryptocurrency market volatility** using historical OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data, trading volume, and market capitalization.  
By forecasting volatility, the model assists traders and investors in making data-driven decisions, managing risks, and identifying unstable market periods.

## 3️⃣ Major Components

### A. Data Layer
- **Input:** Historical cryptocurrency dataset (OHLC, volume, market cap).  
- **Output:** Cleaned and preprocessed data ready for feature engineering.  
- Handles missing values, inconsistent data, and normalization.

### B. Feature Engineering
- Generate rolling metrics, moving averages, volatility indicators.  
- Compute liquidity ratios (volume / market cap) and technical indicators (Bollinger Bands, ATR).  
- Enhance predictive power of the model.

### C. Modeling Layer
- **Algorithm:** Random Forest Regressor (ensemble learning).  
- **Optimization:** Hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation (TimeSeriesSplit).  
- **Metrics:** MAE, RMSE, R² to assess model performance.

### D. Evaluation Layer
- Analyze predicted vs actual volatility.  
- Identify most important features affecting predictions.  
- Save model and scaler for reproducibility.

### E. Deployment Layer (Optional)
- Streamlit or Flask app to upload new data and generate predictions.  
- Enables interactive visualization and download of results.
